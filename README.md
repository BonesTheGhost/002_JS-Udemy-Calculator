============================================================== April 9th 2020::

This is the intro application for getting a handle on the basic syntax and conventions of JavaScript in 2020. I am about 4 hours into the course at this point as this course was started in tandem with the C++ Unreal Udemy course, and several other courses as well.

As such, the code present in this repository is NOT ENTIRELY of my origin. What this means is that though I am following along with the videos step-by-step and manually entering the code and debugging in order to maximize the educational value, much of the core program is provided for learning purposes through the course.

Personally, I enjoy attempting to alter the code as my abilities improve, or otherwise add in my own personal stylistic changes to make it my own. Essentially, this repo should be viewed as proof of time and effort invested, and a relative skill-level/level of experience.

The course can be found on Udemy.com with the title: "Javascript - The Complete Guide 2020 (Beginner + Advanced)"

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Progress to this point:

+ Learned that JavaScript is weakly-typed and compiled at runtime. (This is a massive noticeable difference now that I am also studying C++ at the same time!).
+ Refreshed naming conventions, basic syntax, function definitions, return, and event-listeners.

= The program right now is not quite functional yet. The webpage HTML and vendor.js files were provided to handle most of the extra complexity of such a page. I have reviewed the syntax there and much of it is familiar. Excited to get to the deeper complexities again of vanilla JS so I can separate vanilla JS from jQuery and React.js in my own skill-set.
